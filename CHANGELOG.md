# dbt_recurly v0.5.0
[PR #29](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_recurly/pull/29) includes the following breaking changes:
## Breaking Changes
- Removed unused fields from `stg_recurly__subscription_history` in the upstream `dbt_recurly_source` package (see [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_recurly_source/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#dbt_recurly_source-v030)):
  - `converted_at`
  - `has_started_with_gift`
- While this change does not directly affect fields in this packageâ€™s models, it is classified as a breaking change due to modifications in `stg_recurly__subscription_history`.
- These fields were removed as they are slated for future deprecation in the Fivetran Connector and are not explicitly referenced in the final models.

# dbt_recurly v0.4.0

[PR #26](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_recurly/pull/26) includes the following breaking changes:

## Feature Updates
- Addition of the `recurly__line_item_enhanced` model. This model constructs a comprehensive, denormalized analytical table that enables reporting on key revenue, subscription, customer, and product metrics from your billing platform. Itâ€™s designed to align with the schema of the `*__line_item_enhanced` model found in Recurly, Recharge, Stripe, Shopify, and Zuora, offering standardized reporting across various billing platforms. To see the kinds of insights this model can generate, explore example visualizations in the [Fivetran Billing Model Streamlit App](https://fivetran-billing-model.streamlit.app/). Visit the app for more details.
  -  This model is currently disabled by default. You may enable it by setting the `recurly__standardized_billing_model_enabled` as `true` in your `dbt_project.yml`.

## Under the Hood:
- Added consistency test within integration_tests for the `recurly__line_item_enhanced` model.
- Included auto-releaser GitHub Actions workflow to automate future releases.
- Incorporated the new `fivetran_utils.drop_schemas_automation` macro into the end of each Buildkite integration test job.
- Updated the pull request templates.

# dbt_recurly v0.3.2
## ðŸª² Bug Fixes ðŸ”§
- Created a `unique_combination_of_columns` test on the `balance_transaction_id` and `transaction_id` columns in `recurly__balance_transactions` to account for line items with multiple transactions. Also modified relevant seed files to test these changes ([PR #21](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_recurly/pull/21)).
- Updated `current_timestamp` macros in `int_recurly__account_cumulatives` and `recurly__account_overview` models to `current_timestamp_backcompat`, in accordance with the dbt-utils update from the v0.3.0 release ([#20](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_recurly/issues/20)).

# dbt_recurly v0.3.1
## Documentation Update
- Corrected the yaml variable names in [step 4 of the README doc](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_recurly#step-4-disable-models-for-non-existent-sources) to reflect the proper names used within the package. ([#18](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_recurly/pull/18))

# dbt_recurly v0.3.0
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Change and ðŸŽ‰ Feature
- Intermediate models now materialize in their own schema named `recurly_int`. This is to reduce noise in the schema for the final model outputs. ([#15](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_recurly/pull/15))
  - **Note:** Before running this new version, we recommend that you manually remove any `int_recurly...` tables from the original output schema. 
## ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes
- Updated how `date_week` is determined in model `int_recurly__account_rolling_totals`. ([#15](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_recurly/pull/15))

# dbt_recurly v0.2.0
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨:
[PR #7](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_recurly/pull/7) includes the following breaking changes:
- Dispatch update for dbt-utils to dbt-core cross-db macros migration. Specifically `{{ dbt_utils.<macro> }}` have been updated to `{{ dbt.<macro> }}` for the below macros:
    - `any_value`
    - `bool_or`
    - `cast_bool_to_text`
    - `concat`
    - `date_trunc`
    - `dateadd`
    - `datediff`
    - `escape_single_quotes`
    - `except`
    - `hash`
    - `intersect`
    - `last_day`
    - `length`
    - `listagg`
    - `position`
    - `replace`
    - `right`
    - `safe_cast`
    - `split_part`
    - `string_literal`
    - `type_bigint`
    - `type_float`
    - `type_int`
    - `type_numeric`
    - `type_string`
    - `type_timestamp`
    - `array_append`
    - `array_concat`
    - `array_construct`
- For `current_timestamp` and `current_timestamp_in_utc` macros, the dispatch AND the macro names have been updated to the below, respectively:
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_backcompat`
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_in_utc_backcompat`
- `dbt_utils.surrogate_key` has also been updated to `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key`. Since the method for creating surrogate keys differ, we suggest all users do a `full-refresh` for the most accurate data. For more information, please refer to dbt-utils [release notes](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/releases) for this update.
- Dependencies on `fivetran/fivetran_utils` have been upgraded, previously `[">=0.3.0", "<0.4.0"]` now `[">=0.4.0", "<0.5.0"]`.

# Features  
- Refactored the `recurly__account_daily_overview` to prevent query timeouts, brought up in [#8](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_recurly/issues/8).
- Created intermediate models previously present in `recurly__account_daily_overview` to optimize runtime for advanced loop functions, `int_recurly__account_partitions` and `int_recurly__account_running_totals`. 
- Changed intermediate folder materializations from ephemeral to table because of complexity of calculations. 

## Under the Hood
- Updated the condition for involuntary churn to include `tax_location_invalid` in addition to `non-payment` types. ([#10](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_recurly/pull/10))

# dbt_recurly v0.1.0

## Initial Release
This is the initial release of this package. 

__What does this dbt package do?__
- Produces modeled tables that leverage Recurly data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/recurly) in the format described [here](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/recurly#schemainformation) and builds off the output of our [Recurly source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_recurly_source).

- The above mentioned models enable you to better understand your Recurly performance metrics at different granularities. It achieves this by:
  - Providing intuitive reporting at the account, balance transaction and subscription levels.
  - Builds a daily overview of account balance activity based on account and transaction tables.
  - Generates monthly recurring revenue table at the account level.
  - Generates churn analysis table at the subscription level.
  - Aggregates all relevant metrics into each of the reporting levels above.
  - Generate a metrics table that allows you to better understand your account activity over time or at a customer level. These time-based metrics are available on a daily level.
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your source and modeled Recurly data via the [dbt docs site](fivetran.github.io/dbt_recurly/)
